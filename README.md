PalindromeChecker App (UC3)

A simple console-based Java application that checks whether a given string is a palindrome by reversing it using a for loop.

This project strengthens fundamental Java concepts including loops, string handling, immutability, and content comparison.

 Objective

The objective of this use case (UC3) is to:

1.Reverse a string using a for loop

2.Compare the reversed string with the original

3.Display whether the string is a palindrome

4.Understand how String immutability works in Java

5.Use equals() for proper string comparison
